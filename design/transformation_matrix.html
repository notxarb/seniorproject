    <h1>Transformation Matrix</h1>
    <h2>Definitions:</h2>

    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>Descriptions:</h2>
    <p>
      This will take input from the settings panel and generate a matrix for WebGL to use for rotation of the graph.
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#General_rotations">general rotations</a> yaw, pitch and roll.
      May be fun to see this matrix.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will need to have the following functions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Multiply Matrix - This function is used to combine the rotations and transposing operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rotate - This needs to be able to take x, y, and z rotations and multiply them together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Translate - This needs to be able to take x, y, and z and make linear translations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create Transformation Matrix - This needs to take the rotations and translations and multiply them together to generate the final one.
        </li>
        <li>
          To GL Matrix - WebGL wants the values in a 1 dimensional array, read down the column.
        </li>
      </ul>
