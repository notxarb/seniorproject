Wecome to the senior project of Braxton Huggins.

Here is a list of directories and what you will find there:

css - This is where the css for the site goes. It currently doesn't have any
      real css.
design - This is where to find the requirements and design documentation.
glsl - This is where the vertex and fragment shaders are.
js - All the JavaScript.
prototype - This is where I was first playing around with code.
test - This is where I set up tests for asymptotic, implicit, and parametric
       equations

The js folder has a few javascript files. In order to make 3 dimensional
graphs, you will need to include all except for navagation.js in your HTML 
document. The navagation.js has a helper function for making a row in a table
act as a link.
