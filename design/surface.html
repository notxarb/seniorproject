      This will have a reference to a subset of the points. This will be able to generate points for drawing to WebGL.
      This will need the following functions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Initialize Buffers - This is to store the points in WebGL for usage. This function will iterate through the array of points and generate a set of triangle strips. This will also determine empty space in the graph, and asymptotes and generate the graphs around them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Draw - This is to draw the surface. This will have to call the set uniform data, and bind buffers into WebGL.
        </li>
      </ul>
