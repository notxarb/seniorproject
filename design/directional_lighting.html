    <h1>Directional Lighing</h1>
    <h2>Definitions:</h2>
      Directional Lighting - Parallel light beams that share a common vector for direction.

    <h2>Descriptions:</h2>
    <p>
      This will hold data to be pulled into the vertex shader. It will need to have the following property.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Color - An array holding floating point values representing red, green, and blue.
          Vector - An array holding floating point values representing x, y, and z components of a vector.
        </li>
      </ul>
      This will need the following function:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unit Vector - This will take the value in vector and calculate a unit vector for it. This is used when passing in the light direction to the vertex shader.
        </li>
      </ul>
