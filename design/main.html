    <h1>Main</h1>
    <h2>Definitions:</h2>
      Main - Commonly used in programming to hold main flow of a program.

      This will take care of basic set up of the WebGL. This will also take care of user input and adjust other objects to account for desired changes.
      This will need to have the following attributes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          GL - This is the reference to interact with the WebGL binding from the canvas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transformation Matrix - This is used to store rotation and translation information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Perspective Matrix - This is used to calculate how to adjust the image to give perspective to the objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ambient Light - This stores the information on ambient lighting to use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Directional Light - This stores the information needed to calculate the directional lighting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shader Program - This is where the vertex and fragment shaders are registered with WebGL.
        </li>
        <li>
          Equation - This is where the equation data is stored, points are generated, and other things related to the graph.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Main will need the following functions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          On Page Load - This takes an equation as a string, or an array and passes it to equation. It also initializes all other objects needed to display a graph.
        </li>
        <li>
          Initialize Canvas - This will get the canvas ready to run WebGL.
        </li>
        <li>
          Initialize Transformation Matrix - This will get initial values from the form and initialize the transformation matrix object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Initialize Perspective Matrix - This will get initial values from the form and initialize the perspective matrix object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Initialize Ambient Light - This will get initial values from the form and initialize the ambient lighting object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Initialize Directional Light - This will get initial values from the form and initialize the directional lighting object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get Shader - This will make a web request to get the glsl files for the vertex and fragment shaders.
        </li>
        <li>
          Initialize Shaders - This calls the Get Shader function and registers the shaders with the WebGL binding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Update Transformation Matrix - This will get updated values from the form and update the transformation matrix object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Update Perspective Matrix - This will get updated values from the form and update the perspective matrix object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Update Ambient Light - This will get updated values from the form and update the ambient lighting object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Update Directional Light - This will get updated values from the form and update the directional lighting object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set Matrix Uniforms - This binds values from the transformation matrix, perspective matrix, ambient lighting, and directional lighting with the vertex shader.
        </li>
      </ul>
