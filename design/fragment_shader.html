      This will be written in GLSL. This determines the actual color of the pixel. This is done by multiplying the desired color with a lighting factor.
      This will need the following properties set by the vertex shader:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Color - This is the desired color for the pixel as if the light were at 100 percent on it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Light wighting - This is how much light is actually hitting the pixel.
        </li>
      </ul>
