    <h1>Equation</h1>
    <h2>Definitions:</h2>
      Equation - representation of equality.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>Descriptions:</h2>
    <p>
      This is where the function(s) that define the graph would be. The equation would potentially have several surfaces. Equations will need to have the following functions:
      <ul>
        <li>Asymptote detection - This will determine how many surfaces the equation will need to have.</li>
        <li>Point generation - This would be a good place for the points to be created, and then sorted out into surfaces as the asymptote detection decides.</li>
        <li>Surface generation - This create the surfaces and determine which points belong.</li>
      </ul>
      This will also need to know if the equation is implicit or parametric, and have either a single equation for z, or have an equation for each x, y, and z.
      It will need references to its generated points, and surfaces.
