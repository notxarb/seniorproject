    <h1>Main</h1>
    <h2>Definitions:</h2>
      Main - Commonly used in programming to hold main flow of a program.

    <h2>Descriptions:</h2>

      This will take care of basic set up of the WebGL. This will also take care of user input and adjust other objects to account for desired changes.
      This will need to have the following attributes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          GL - This is the reference to interact with the WebGL binding from the canvas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transformation Matrix - This is used to store rotation and translation information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Perspective Matrix - This is used to calculate how to adjust the image to give perspective to the objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ambient Light - This stores the information on ambient lighting to use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Directional Light - This stores the information needed to calculate the directional lighting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shader Program - This is where the vertex and fragment shaders are registered with WebGL.
        </li>
        <li>
          Equation - This is where the equation data is stored, points are generated, and other things related to the graph.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Main will need the following functions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          On Page Load - This takes an equation as a string, or an array and passes it to equation. It also initializes all other objects needed to display a graph.
        </li>
        <li>
          Initialize Canvas - This will get the canvas ready to run WebGL.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
