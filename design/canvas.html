    <h1>Canvas</h1>
    <h2>Definitions:</h2>
      Canvas is the HTML 5 element that displays graphical output to the user.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>Descriptions:</h2>
      In order to use the canvas with WebGL, it will need to have the following functions:
      <ul>
        <li>Canvas Initializer - This will set up the canvas to have WebGL bindings.</li>
        <li>Shader Initializer - This will get shaders ready to be used within the rest of the program.</li>
        <li>Draw - This will call the draw function from the equations, and make sure the transformation matrix and shaders are used.</li>
      </ul>
