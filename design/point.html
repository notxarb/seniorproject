    <h1>Point</h1>
    <h2>Definitions:</h2>
      Point - A representation of a position in 3 space using coordinates x, y, and z.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>Descriptions:</h2>
    <p>
      A surface is comprised of 3 or more points.
      Point generation for an implicit function will generate values by iterating across the range of x values. For each x, it will iterate across the range of y values. For each x, y pair, it will generate values for z using the supplied function.
      Point generation for parametric equations will generate values by iterating across the range of u values. For each u, it will iterate across the range of v values. For each u, v pair, it will generate values for x, y, and z using the supplied functions.
      A point will need the following attributes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Coordinates - x, y, z
        </li>
        <li>
          Normal - This is a vector x, y, and z that is normal to this point.
        </li>
      </ul>
      A point will need the following functions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cross - This will take two points as arguments and create vector's from this point to each of the other vectors, and then take the cross product. This is used in the Equation's Generate Normal's function.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vector - This will take one point as an argument and create a vector from this point to the other point. This is used in the Cross function.
        </li>
      </ul>
